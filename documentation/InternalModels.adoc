The internal data model of the mimirProfiler consists of several parts. Most notably

- profile
- vocabulary
- constraints


== Profile

The internal data model of the mimirProfiler is based on the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/[dx-Prof specification].

== Vocabulary

The vocabulary is the open-world model that specifies (data) definitions in a use-case a-specific way. An important goal of such a vocabulary is to make data from different systems, processes and organizations interoperable.

In the mimirProfiler, the vocabulary is modelled according to the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language[OWL]
